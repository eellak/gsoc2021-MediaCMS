# GSoC-21-MediaCMS

Hello World! My name is Shubhank Saxena and I have been selected as the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) contributor to the MediaCMS project under GFOSS Open Technology Alliance for the year 2021.

Here is the link of my selected proposal - [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4980672680165376)

This repository is a mirror of the original [MediaCMS](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms) repository and will house all the contributions that I will make during my GSoC 2021.

The original readme for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms#readme)
